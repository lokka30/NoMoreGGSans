# NoMoreGGSans

On December 1st 2022, Discord [updated their main font to GG Sans](https://gamertweak.com/change-font-back-old-discord/) without offering users any way of using the old (or any other) font.
Fortunately for this case, Discord is a web app, allowing us to simply override the styling used. This tiny file brings back peace and harmony
in the Discord interface with a font we're used to.

## Requirements

1. The Discord web app, ran on the Firefox web browser.
2. A stylesheet override tool such as [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) (recommended).
3. The 'Whitney' font. It was somewhat tricky to find, as there are a bunch of different fonts of this name. [CuFonFonts](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/whitney-2) seems to have the correct version.

## Usage

Using the stylesheet extension of your choice, simply copy the CSS code in, reload Discord, and you're all sorted. :)
